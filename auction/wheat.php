     Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed,a cereal grain that is a worldwide staple food. The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum the most widely grown is common wheat.The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BC. Botanically,the wheat kernel is a caryopsis, a type of fruit.
     Wheat is the second most important staple food after rice consumed by 65% of the population in India and is likely to increase further due to changes in food habits. Wheat is mostly consumed in the form of ‘chapati’ in our country for which bread wheat is cultivated in nearly 95 per cent of the cropped area. Durum wheat, which is most suitable for making macaroni, noodles, semolina and pasta products, occupies about 4 to 5% of the area, and is predominantly grown in Central and Peninsular parts of India.
