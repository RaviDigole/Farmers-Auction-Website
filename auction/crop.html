   Crops are a fundamental source of human sustenance, providing the majority of the world's food supply. A diverse range of crops, including grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, contribute to a balanced and nutritious diet.Many people worldwide depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Farming communities, both small-scale and large-scale, rely on the cultivation of crops for income and sustenance.Crops serve as raw materials for various industries. For example, cotton is used in textile manufacturing, sugarcane for sugar production, and oilseeds for vegetable oil extraction.Certain crops, such as sugarcane and corn, are used in the production of biofuels. Bioenergy derived from crops can contribute to renewable energy sources and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
